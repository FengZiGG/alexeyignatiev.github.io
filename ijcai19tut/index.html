            This tutorial overviews the uses of SAT solvers as oracles, when
            employed for solving a wide range of computational problems, and
            illustrates their use in several practical applications, including
            the recent uses in explaining non-interpretable machine learning
            models.
        </p>

        <h4 class="point">long description</h4>
        <p>
            Propositional satisfiability (SAT) is a success story of computer
            science. The power of the conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL)
            paradigm underlying most of the state-of-the-art SAT solvers made
            them an irreplaceable tool-of-choice suitable for efficient
            industrial problem solving. Indeed, a SAT solver can be seen as a
            witness producing NP-oracle, which can be applied to solving
            decision problems in NP but also beyond NP, e.g. in higher levels
            of the polynomial hierarchy, as well as function and enumeration
            problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mission of the tutorial is to give a comprehensive overview of
            the modern SAT solving technology and how SAT solvers are
            exploited for constraint problem solving, as well as for solving
            extensions and generalizations of SAT, i.e. when dealing with
            optimization and enumeration problems. Additionally, the tutorial
            will focus on applying SAT solvers as oracles to a variety of
            strategic practical applications ranging from graph optimization
            problems, model-based diagnosis to cooperative path-finding as
            well as verification and explanation of machine learning models.
            The tutorial will bring together the details of problem encodings
            into SAT, maximum and minimum satisfiability (MaxSAT/MinSAT),
            minimal unsatisfiability (MUS computation), quantified Boolean
            formulas (QBF), but also efficient SAT-based algorithms targeting
            the aforementioned problems.

        <h4 class="point">audience and objectives</h4>
        <p>
            IJCAI participants interested in artificial intelligence,
            constraint programming, and its applications in machine learning.
            The use of SAT solvers as oracles has enabled impressive inroads
            in solving a wide range of computational problems. These include
            well-known function problems, e.g. computing explanations and
            relaxations of overconstrained formulas, but also solving
            optimization, quantification and enumeration problems, to name a
            few. Recent applications of computing with SAT oracles include
            computing interpretable machine learning models, but also finding
            explanations for non-interpretable machine learning models. A
            tutorial on this topic offers advanced training in a range of
            technologies that finds an ever growing range of practical
            applications. This tutorial introduces novices to a key topic in
            AI (SAT and constraint solving, and its applications), it
            motivates and explains how to use SAT solvers as backend solver(s)
            in different and emerging areas of AI, and it surveys and provides
            training in a common practice in AI.
